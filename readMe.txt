The movie recommendation system has been developed using an open source python library called scikit surprise. And the program has been tested in anaconda integrated development environment. To run the program please follow the below procedure step by step:

1. Install pandas : 
$ conda install pandas
or via pip-> pip install pandas
or you may install full anaconda by-> conda install anaconda

2. Install numpy:
$ conda install -c anaconda numpy
or via pip-> pip install numpy

3. Install Scikit surprise:
$ conda install -c conda-forge scikit-surprise 
or via pip-> pip install scikit-surprise

4. Install seaborn(for visualization):
$ conda install seaborn
or via pip -> pip install seaborn

Now, you are ready to execute the program. It will ask you to provide the customer ID, Movie ID, Year of release etc. We have visualized a part of dataset from which you can pick one or you can provide any value from the dataset. 

In case there is a problem in running the code have a look in the outputsnapshot file to see our result.
